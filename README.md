Local AWS S3
============

When developing applications that use AWS SDK for uploading and downloading assets from S3 you will need:

- An Amazon AWS account
- Pay every X requests ([more here](http://aws.amazon.com/en/s3/pricing/))
- Internet Connection

This tool should not be used in production!
Use it only for developing and testing.
